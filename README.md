# fly-on-the-wall
The final project titled "Fly on The Wall" for DIG 245 - Critical Web Design, Fall 2023. A collaborative project by Jeremy Kemp &amp; Yumna Ahmed.

# What is Fly on the Wall?
Fly on the Wall is a digital project aiming to educate users about some information that can easily be collected about them when they use the internet. While none of the information that can be collected without the user's permission may be highly sensitive or personal*, we believe the users should still be aware of what websites can learn about them. As the world becomes increasingly digital with each passing day, the need for users to be aware of how their data may be collected (and why, for that matter) becomes more apparent.

The name is inspired from quite literally imagining what a fly sitting on the wall can learn about you. You are using your device currently; if a fly had the intellectual capabilities, it could probably tell your location, time of the day, weather, the type of device you're using, etc. by just observing you from where it is hanging out on the wall - and you wouldn't have a clue!

_*unless someone deliberately implements unethical code to collect sensitive info without the user's consent._

# Software Information
The code implemented in this project made use of the following interfaces to collect user info:

- The Window interface (part of JavaScript by default; allows JS to communicate with the browser).
- The Navigator interface, that inherits the Window interface.
- An external API: IP Geolocation API. This accessed the user location and currency data.

### Privacy Concerns
Please note that this project does not collect user info to store. It temporarily accesses location information to demonstrate the capability of the web and aims to make users aware of this possibility. Data remains private and is not used maliciously. This project is not created for distribution.  

# Who made Fly on the Wall?
This project was made by Jeremy Kemp '25 and Yumna Ahmed '25 from Davidson College, under the guidance of Prof. Owen Mundy. It was made as part of the DIG-245 Critical Web Design class offered Fall 2023.
